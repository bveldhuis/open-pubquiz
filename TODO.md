### Core Gameplay
18. **Question Types**
    - [x] Image-based questions
    - [x] Audio questions
    - [x] Video questions
    - [x] True/false questions
    - [x] Numerical questions
    - [x] Sample questions updated in both backend and frontend
    - [x] Auto-scoring implemented for all question types
    - [x] Fuzzy matching for open text questions (handles typos)
    - [x] Review display improvements for all question types
    - [x] Correct answer display for numerical questions with tolerance

19. **Scoring System**
    - [x] Auto-scoring for multiple choice, true/false, numerical, image, audio, video questions
    - [x] Fuzzy matching for open text questions (using node-nlp with multi-language support)
    - [x] Advanced NLP processing with automatic language detection (EN, NL, DE, FR, ES, IT, PT, RU, JA, KO, ZH)
    - [x] Anti-cheating measures: minimum answer length, word-level matching, higher similarity thresholds
    - [x] Stricter fuzzy matching: 95% Jaro-Winkler, 90% Levenshtein, 90% word match ratio to prevent wrong answers
    - [x] Sequence scoring: full points for perfect order, 1 point for single adjacent swap, 0 points otherwise
    - [x] Manual override capability for all question types
    - [x] **Fixed fuzzy matching algorithm - ALL 36 tests now pass! Fixed critical bug where empty NLP processing results caused false matches**
    - [ ] Bonus points for speed

## üõ† Infrastructure & DevOps

### Deployment & Monitoring
